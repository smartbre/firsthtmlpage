        <h1 class="topHeading"> TOP Five Healthy and Delicious Low-Carb Recipies! </h1>
        <p1 class="pstyle1">Keto is the new buzz-word now-adays. After years of yo-yo dieting, I have have finally found the perfect healthy lifestyle: Keto.
        <br><br>
            For those of you who are ready to try keto, here are a few tips that helped me on my Keto-journey:
            <ol>
                <li> Assess your diet AND habits - Look for areas were sugar creeps into to your diet. I aim to keep my carb intake below NET grams.</li>
                <li> Create (and stick to) healthier realistic habits - Take time to create and implement habits that will help transition to Keto. I meal-prep every meal over the weekendd.</li>
                <li> Experiment! - Our bodies are complex so you must do what is best for you. Obviously do your research, but you should also be strategic in buying your groceries from customer-centric stores (Trader Joes and Costco have VERY generous retunr policies).</li>
                <li> Trust the Process - It will feel hard. In fact, our brains will trick us into thinking that it's harder than it acutally is. I invite you to acknoledge any feelings that surface and keep your eye on a healthier you!</li>
            </ol>
